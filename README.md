# UnityEmbeddedCodeEditor 0.1

Very simple, very limited, in-Editor C# script editor for Unity.

This is a small editor window that lets you open and edit `.cs` files directly inside the Unity Editor.  
No external IDE, no Rider, no VS Code. Just Unity, IMGUI, and questionable life choices.

## Please don’t use this as your main code editor

Seriously.

This tool exists because sometimes you just want to:

- Quickly tweak a script  
- Inspect or adjust generated code  
- Edit something while deliberately avoiding a full IDE reload  

It is not fast.  
It is not smart.  
It has no syntax highlighting, no autocomplete, no error checking, and no understanding of what you’re typing.

## This editor is bad. Really.

Unless:

- You know exactly what you’re doing  
- You accept Unity’s domain reload pain  
- You value “good enough right now” over “correct tooling”  

You
